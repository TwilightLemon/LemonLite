**Effective Date:** 2025-12-01

This Privacy Policy describes how **Lemon Lite** ("the Application", "we", "our", or "us") handles user data. By using the Application, you agree to the terms described in this Privacy Policy.



## 1. Information We Collect

The Application reads **SMTC (System Media Transport Controls)** data from the operating system in order to:

* Detect the currently playing media session

The Application **does not** play any media itself.
The media content originates from applications the user has chosen to allow via SMTC.

### 1.2 Local Configuration Files

The Application may read/write **local configuration files** (e.g., app settings). No personal data is stored.

### 1.3 Network Requests

The Application may fetch **song metadata and lyrics from user‑configured servers** or public services.

* Users may host and customize their own metadata/lyrics server.
* No personal data is included in these requests.

### 1.4 No Personal Information Collected

The Application does **not** collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information (PII).
User login or account creation is not required.

## 2. How Information Is Used

How Information Is Used
Any information accessed by the Application is used **exclusively for functional purposes**, including:

* Loading configuration and lyric data from local text files
* Communicating with online APIs (if enabled by the user)
* Providing core lyric viewer features

No information is shared with third parties.


## 3. Permissions and Capabilities

The Application may request the following:

* **File System Access (local app folder only):** For reading/writing configuration and lyric files.
* **Network Access:** For connecting to online services.
* **runFullTrust:** Required to maintain compatibility with legacy components of the WPF framework, enable essential file operations, and ensure stable application functionality.

The Application will **never** access documents, pictures, or other personal folders unless explicitly chosen by the user.


## 4. Data Sharing and Disclosure

Your data never leaves your device unless you intentionally export or share it.

## 5. Third-Party Services

We do not send personal data to these services.

## 6. Children's Privacy
